        "It's no secret that video games have exploded in popularity, capturing the interest of people across various ages and experiences. Minecraft, in particular, attracts a diverse range of players—from casual gamers logging just a few hours to enthusiasts investing significant playtime. For research projects that depend on collecting large amounts of player data, understanding which players contribute the most can dramatically improve recruitment strategies.\n",

This helps collect more data and ensures resources (like software licenses and servers) are used efficiently.
